# Learning Experience
  This project required me to build of exsisting skills while learning many new ones.  It was very demanding in SASS, which allowed me to learn proper management and planning skills.  Throughout the duration of this project, I had many frustrations, most of them involved wordpress not responding to the changes in my code.  I still have a lot of fixes to do to this site and am driven to continue the struggle to make it perfect.

## Installation

### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content` directory.

### 2. Rename the `redstarter-master` directory

Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate!

### 3. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here]` to the appropriate localhost URL).
